QuickQuote web application for the DevOps Accelerator Demo


build.xml assumes the following:

1.) Tomcat is installed
2.) CATALINA_HOME is set
3.) Start/stop tomcat does NOT require a password

If all three of these are true, running 'ant deploy' will get the app running:
http://localhost:8080/quickquote/index.jsp

If something is different about your config, running 'ant war' will build the war in dist/.

To add/remove radio buttons from the main page, edit com.servicemesh.devops.demo.quickquote.QuoteResource.java

Simply add/remove an item to the List<String> in the getInsuranceTypesData() function.
